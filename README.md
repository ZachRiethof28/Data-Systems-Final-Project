# 2021 MLB Pitches Thrown Analysis

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of a Data Systems course to demonstrate practical data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and analysis skills using Python. It is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:

- `Final Project (Part 1).ipynb` – Data cleaning and preparation  
- `Final Project (Part 2).ipynb` – Data analysis and visualization  

The goal was to work through a real-world dataset and prepare it for meaningful insights through structured data workflows.

## Files Included

- `Final Project (Part 1).ipynb` – Covers data loading, missing values, standardization, and transformation  
- `Final Project (Part 2).ipynb` – Focuses on data grouping, aggregation, visualization, and insights

## Key Concepts Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering  
- Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Grouping and Aggregation with Pandas

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository or download the notebooks**

2. **Install the necessary Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. **Open the notebooks in Jupyter:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Run the cells in order to follow the project workflow.
